NOTES:
* To add or remove a dependency from "package.json" simply add it or delete it 
from the list and then run: npm install

* another method to add a dependency "moment" is: npm i moment  or mpn install mement

* app.js is the component, bootstrap.js injects the code into /static/index.html

* "favicon" is the little logo next to google tab
* we should never change manually node_moles nor package-lock.json
* ~ (tilda) vs ^ (caret).  tilda:
    ~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.
    ^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.xrelease including 1.3.0, but will hold off on 2.0.0.
